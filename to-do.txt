Milestone 3
---------------
TODO - High to low importance
------------------------------

- Leverages memcache for performance. (directly impacts grade) look into this... may not implement

- Make sure challenges look nice when questions are long

- checkmark for completed q's


DONT WORRY ABOUT THIS NOW
--------------------------
- How should we format ndb models so that users have access to lobbies, can create lobbies, blah blah blah
- public leaderboard only reflects admin uploaded challenges


JACK IS WORKING ON
---------------------
- solveChallenges should work for ANY lobbyID. the public one SHOULD display all of the admins challenges (jnapp18@gmail.com)

- Leaderboard should be lobbyID specific

- unique lobbies

- lobbies needs to get developed

- leaderboard on per lobby basis

- limit challenge name length and lobby name length





DONE
-----------------------
- answers need to be pulled through ajax, not stored in the web page
- point tracking, keeping track of score
- my challenges tab
- need to actually get zip downloads working
