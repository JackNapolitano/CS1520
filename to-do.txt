Milestone 3
---------------
TODO - High to low importance
------------------------------
- Leverages memcache for performance. (directly impacts grade)

- lobbies needs to get developed

- need to actually get zip downloads working

- my challenges tab

- leaderboard on per lobby basis

- flagging system to prevent inappropriate uploads

- Only admin uploaded challenges count toward the leaderboard

- Leverages one external API or App Engine Service (cron, blobstore, task queues, images, or an external API like Twitter, Google Maps, etc). (this should be handled by zip files)

- No loose ends



DONT WORRY ABOUT THIS NOW
--------------------------
- How should we format ndb models so that users have access to lobbies, can create lobbies, blah blah blah
- public leaderboard only reflects admin uploaded challenges


JACK IS WORKING ON
---------------------
- not sure yet




DONE
-----------------------
- answers need to be pulled through ajax, not stored in the web page
- point tracking, keeping track of score
